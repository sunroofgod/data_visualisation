### About
- View the source code [here](main.ipynb)
- In this project, the goal is to go through the basics of Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy again (as a refresher). It also covers my thought processes of what one should do when trying to do basic Data Analysis on a given Dataset.
    - This includes: Data Cleaning, How to Structure your Data using Pandas, Indexing, Filtering, Graphing Techniques, Observation of Trends, Types of graphs and its Advantages.
- The Dataset was obtained from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).

### The Elpehant in the Room 
What is this project about? Well, here's a question for you. Ever wondered how 'Popular' your birthday is? Well, in this project, I go in-depth into a Dataset containing U.S. births data for the years 1994 to 2003.

### About
- View the source code [here](main.ipynb)
- In this project, I wanted to see if I could find interesting trends and patterns regarding the Day of the Month, the Day of the Week as well as the Year that a person was born in.
- This also allowed me to go through the basics of Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy again (as a refresher). 
- This proejct also covers my thought processes of what one should do when trying to do basic Data Analysis on a given Dataset.
    - This includes: Data Cleaning, How to Structure your Data using Pandas, Indexing, Filtering, Graphing Techniques, Observation of Trends, Types of graphs and its Advantages.
- The Dataset was obtained from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). (TYSM!)
